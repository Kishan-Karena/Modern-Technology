                    <strong>Modern Technology</strong> changed a lot from what we saw in the last decade or the past
                    century. New machines and
                    gadgets are invented to make jobs easier like never before. From the little tailor machine to the
                    fastest
                    car in the world, all got automated reducing the manual actions required to the least. Modern
                    technology
                    schools made it easier for students to extract the possibilities of the latest tech inventions.
                    Their impact
                    is enormous in crafting perfect generation expertise in the current technology.

                <h2>What is Modern Technology?</h2>
                <p id="p1"><strong>Modern technology is the advancement of old technology with new additions and
                        modifications.</strong> For
                    example, it is impossible for the people in this decade to live with a wired telephone placed on the
                    table. So, the mobile phone which can be taken with us anywhere is the perfect example of
                    technological advancement or simply, modern technology. Any machine or device we see around us is
                    the product of modern technology. It made things way easier than we could ever imagine.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="p2">Modern technology has impacted every area of our lives and become a crucial factor in no
                    time. We
                    even reached a point where everything we use in our daily life is directly or indirectly related to
                    the technological advancement of some form. So, modern technology cannot be avoided even if we
                    intentionally wanted to.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="image/What-is-Modern-Technology.jpg" id="i3">
                <p class="p1">It is all about doing things in a much quicker, efficient way by improving the workflow.
                    Either it could be helping humans or doing the task alone, machines are always better in terms of
                    accuracy and efficiency. So, we are taking advantage of them to make our jobs easier. The
                    realization that we can do a lot more stuff within minimal time, with less effort paved the path to
                    modern technology as we see today.</p>

        <h2>Examples of Modern Technology</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="p1">The latest modern technology examples include the 5G network which provides blazing fast
                    internet to the users, self-driving cars, and reusable satellite launchers. But it is not limited to
                    just these things. The technological progress we have made and the number of tools we have invented
                    is beyond imagination. Here is a list of modern technology inventions that turned our lives easier
                    and enhanced the easiness of performing operations in every industry. These are the<strong> examples
                        of
                        modern technology.</strong></p>
                <br>
                <h2>1. VR Headsets</h2>
                <img src="image/VR-Headsets.jpg" class="ilg">
                <br>
                <p class="p1">In this modernized tech world, the place of VR headsets is no more hidden. The virtual
                    world is directly taken in front of your eyes by just wearing a box-shaped headset. As you can see
                    in the above image, the VR headsets are very convenient and easily available in the stores. Here is
                    a funny video prank on a man who wore the VR headset, and a rollercoaster is taken in front of his
                    eyes. Watching it will give you an exact idea about the power of VR headsets in tricking your eyes
                    and mind.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>2. Smartwatches</h2>
                <br>
                <img src="image/Smartwatches.jpg" class="ilg">
                <p class="p1"><strong>Smartwatches</strong> are just a variation of regular watches but come with a
                    bunch of features as
                    your smartphone. You can make calls, text your friends, browse the internet, and even take photos
                    sometimes.<strong> In the contemporary tech world,</strong> smartwatches do stand a chance in
                    increasing the
                    productivity of users. Instead of taking out the smartphone each time to answer a call, or text a
                    friend, it is way much easier to use your own watch. The Apple Watch Series 2 and Samsung Gear S3
                    are some best examples of smartwatches.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>3. Robots</h2>
                <br>
                <img src="image/Robots.jpg" class="ilg">
                <br>
                <p class="p1">Robotics improved a lot in the last few years. Numerous <strong>new inventions</strong>
                    arrived on the
                    market in various forms and for various uses. The robots also widened the possibility of modern
                    technology in education. They are being used to assist the teachers, help students, clean
                    blackboards, clean the classrooms, etc. in hi-tech countries like Japan. They also invented robots
                    that answer to humans utilizing<strong> artificial</strong> intelligence. Look at the following
                    video to get a better
                    idea about how far we reached in robotics.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>4. Bitcoin</h2>
                <br>
                <img src="image/Bitcoin.jpg" class="ilg">
                <br>
                <p class="p1">While modern technology gadgets are discussed above, it is time for something different.
                    Bitcoin might be the best choice when it comes to the digital tech world.<strong> Bitcoin is a
                        virtual money</strong>
                    created by a person who is still not recognized completely. To understand the importance of Bitcoin
                    you have to hear the present-day rate of it. 1 Bitcoin = 896.15 US Dollars as per 01/25/2017. Once
                    it reached even around 1100+. But one of the major disadvantages of Bitcoin is the randomly changing
                    value. The below-given video will provide more information.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>5. Self-Driving Cars</h2>
                <br>
                <img src="image/Self-Driving-Car.jpg" class="ilg">
                <p class="p1">Self-driving cars are another great example of modern technology inventions. Companies
                    like Tesla have been building self-driving cars for a while now and keeps improving them on every
                    new model. You don’t even have to put your hands on the wheel unless of an emergency. The cars will
                    take you to any place marked on the map safely without you even worrying about the traffic. The
                    advanced sensors placed on all sides can not only detect when the car is approaching danger but can
                    also predict the possible issues during the drive. More companies are adapting to self-driving cars
                    and ditching their old technologies.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>6. Cloud Technology</h2>
                <br>
                <img src="image/Cloud-Computing.jpg" class="ilg">
                <p class="p1">Cloud technology is growing rapidly. From hosting websites online to developing artificial
                    intelligence, cloud technology is used everywhere. From the traditional hosting technologies, cloud
                    hosting/cloud computing is significantly different due to its extreme flexibility and expandable
                    features. Cloud technology is being utilized in several areas of the industry such as factories,
                    businesses, research organizations, government organizations, etc. to make their jobs easier. Cloud
                    is the future.</p>

                <img src="image/Modern-Technology-Pros-and-Cons-Advantages-and-Disadvantages.jpg" class="ilg">
                <p class="p1">As we already discussed in the above sections, technology is something which we can’t
                    avoid in our life. If you are looking for the merits and demerits of modern technology, here are a
                    few of them which are more oriented to modern technology than the overall tech. These points explain
                    why we can’t live without technology. These are the<strong> advantages of modern
